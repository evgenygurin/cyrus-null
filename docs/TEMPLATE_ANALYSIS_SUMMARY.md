## Key Innovations

### 1. Agent Session Lifecycle Management
The templates now include complete agent session lifecycle tracking:
- **Initial acknowledgment** (<10 seconds)
- **Activity tracking** (thought, action, elicitation, response, error)
- **State transitions** (Backlog → In Progress → In Review → Done)
- **Timeout management** (30-minute session windows)
- **Parent-child relationships** (hierarchical sessions)

### 2. Multi-Agent Orchestration
Templates support complex multi-agent workflows:
- **Sequential execution** (Agent A → B → C)
- **Parallel execution** (simultaneous work)
- **Hierarchical delegation** (parent delegates to children)
- **Collaborative work** (shared goal, joint execution)

### 3. Platform Integration
Deep integration with external platforms:
- **MCP servers** (Linear, GitHub, filesystem, web search)
- **Repository rules** (.codegen/ directory structure)
- **Tool permissions** (granular security controls)
- **Quality gates** (automated validation)

### 4. Self-Healing Systems
Automated issue detection and recovery:
- **Three-level recovery** (automated attempts)
- **Circuit breaker patterns** (failure threshold management)
- **Escalation workflows** (agent → human → on-call)
- **Root cause analysis** (structured investigation)
