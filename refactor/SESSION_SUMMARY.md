## Date: 2025-01-08
## Branch: feature/codegen-integration-plan

---

## üéØ Session Objective

Analyze the existing orchestrator system prompt and determine what changes are needed to support the Codegen-only architecture approach.

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Accomplished

### 1. **Orchestrator Prompt Analysis**

**File Analyzed:** `packages/edge-worker/prompts/orchestrator.md`

**Key Findings:**
- ‚úÖ Core orchestrator responsibilities remain unchanged (Analyze, Delegate, Evaluate, Iterate)
- ‚úÖ Verification requirements and techniques are architecture-agnostic
- ‚úÖ State management and tracking logic stays the same
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Tool definitions need updating for Codegen
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Execution workflow needs Codegen-specific steps
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing Codegen session configuration context

### 2. **New Document Created**

**File:** `refactor/ORCHESTRATOR_CODEGEN_ALIGNMENT.md` (789 lines)

**Contents:**
- Complete analysis of current orchestrator prompt
- Identified sections that work vs need updates
- Defined 5 new MCP tools needed for Codegen integration:
  1. `mcp__codegen__create_agent_session` - Start Codegen agent for sub-issue
  2. `mcp__codegen__get_session_status` - Monitor session progress
  3. `mcp__codegen__get_session_result` - Retrieve completion results
  4. `mcp__codegen__execute_verification` - Remote verification in Codegen environment
  5. `mcp__codegen__provide_feedback` - Send feedback for iteration

- Updated execution workflow with detailed Codegen-specific steps
- Two verification approaches:
  - **Option A:** Shared filesystem (local verification)
  - **Option B:** Remote verification via Codegen (recommended for cloud)

- Implementation plan: 3-4 weeks broken into 4 phases

### 3. **Documentation Updates**

**File:** `refactor/README.md`

**Changes:**
- Added new "Strategic Context" section
- Included both WHY_CUSTOM_ORCHESTRATOR and ORCHESTRATOR_CODEGEN_ALIGNMENT
- Updated status table with new documents
- Clear navigation for team members

## üîë Key Technical Insights

### 1. **Verification Strategy**

**Critical Decision:** Remote verification recommended over local worktree access

**Reasoning:**
- ‚úÖ No shared filesystem required
- ‚úÖ Simpler cloud deployment
- ‚úÖ Better security (isolation)
- ‚úÖ Consistent environment (same as child agent)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
mcp__codegen__execute_verification({
  sessionId: "codegen-sess-abc123",
  commands: ["npm test", "npm run build", "playwright screenshot ..."],
  captureScreenshots: true
})
```

Returns full verification results including exit codes, stdout, stderr, and screenshots.

### 2. **MCP Tools Architecture**

**New Package Needed:** `packages/codegen-mcp`

**Responsibilities:**
- Codegen API/SDK integration
- Session lifecycle management
- Cost tracking
- Verification execution
- Feedback loops

**Integration with EdgeWorker:**
```typescript
import { CodegenExecutor } from 'cyrus-codegen-executor';

const executor = new CodegenExecutor(config);
const session = await executor.createAgentSession({
  issueId: "LIN-123",
  taskType: "builder",
  context: { ... }
});
```

### 3. **Orchestrator Prompt Updates Required**

**Sections to Update:**
1. **Required Tools** (lines 12-22)
   - Replace Cyrus MCP tools with Codegen MCP tools
   - Keep Linear MCP tools (provided by Codegen)

2. **Execution Workflow** (lines 60-68)
   - Add Codegen-specific session creation steps
   - Update monitoring and result retrieval process
   - Include verification execution via Codegen

3. **New Section Needed:** "Codegen Session Configuration"
   - Repository access
   - Linear integration
   - MCP servers available to child agents
   - Agent role selection
   - Cost tracking

**Sections That Stay the Same:**
- Core responsibilities
- Sub-issue design principles
- Verification requirements (mandatory verification, techniques, recovery)
- State management
- Error recovery logic

## üí° Design Decisions

### 1. **Remote Verification over Local**

**Decision:** Use Codegen's infrastructure for verification instead of local worktree access

**Rationale:**
- Simpler architecture (no shared filesystem needed)
- Better for cloud deployment
- Consistent environment (same as where work was done)
- Security isolation

**Trade-off:** Slightly higher cost (extra Codegen API calls), but worth it for simplicity

### 2. **MCP Tool Granularity**

**Decision:** 5 focused tools instead of 1 monolithic tool

**Rationale:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to test
- Flexible composition
- Better error handling

**Tools:**
1. Create session - Start work
2. Get status - Monitor progress
3. Get result - Retrieve completion
4. Execute verification - Validate work
5. Provide feedback - Iterate

### 3. **Model Selection Enhancement**

**Decision:** Support multiple models beyond just "sonnet"

**Current:**
```markdown
- sonnet ‚Üí Simple tasks
```

**Enhanced:**
```markdown
- sonnet ‚Üí Balanced (default)
- opus ‚Üí Complex, highest quality
- haiku ‚Üí Simple, fastest
- gpt-4 ‚Üí Alternative reasoning
- gemini-pro ‚Üí Multimodal tasks
```

**Rationale:** Leverage Codegen's multi-model support for optimal cost/performance

## üéì Key Learnings

### 1. **Verification is Architecture-Agnostic**

The orchestrator's core responsibility is to verify work quality. This doesn't change whether execution happens locally or in Codegen. The verification techniques (automated tests, interactive UI checks, manual reviews) remain the same - only the **mechanism** changes (local commands vs remote API calls).

### 2. **Prompts Need Context, Not Implementation Details**

The orchestrator prompt should describe **what** needs to happen (create session, verify work, merge changes) not **how** it's implemented (specific API calls, file paths). The MCP tools abstract the implementation details.

### 3. **Remote Verification Simplifies Architecture**

Instead of requiring shared filesystem access between orchestrator and child agents, using Codegen's infrastructure for verification eliminates a major architectural complexity. This is especially valuable for cloud/SaaS deployment.

### 4. **Cost Tracking Must Be Explicit**

In the Codegen-only architecture, every session and verification has a cost. The orchestrator must:
- Track costs per sub-issue
- Aggregate costs for parent issue
- Enforce cost limits (per task, per day)
- Report costs in completion reports

This needs to be built into the MCP tools and orchestrator workflow.

## üìù Final Notes

The orchestrator is the "brain" of Cyrus - it coordinates work but doesn't execute it directly. This session established that:

1. **Core orchestrator logic is solid** - verification requirements, state management, error recovery all remain unchanged
2. **Integration layer needs updating** - new MCP tools for Codegen, updated workflow steps
3. **Remote verification is the way** - simpler, cleaner, better for cloud
4. **Implementation is straightforward** - 3-4 weeks to full Codegen integration

The groundwork is laid. Ready to move to Phase 1 implementation when team approves.
